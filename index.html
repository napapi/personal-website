<h1>Stories of Sensei Napat</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">950AD</h1>
<p>The Original Sensei Napat was born on a mountain in Khmer, a place in Southeast Asia.
During 950, when he was just a little boy, he was sent to battle against the Champa empire. 
With no armor and a homemade sling, against ALL odds, he curageously charged at the battlefield.
