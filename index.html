<h1>The Legend of Sensei Napat</h1>
<p>üìçTHE MOUNTAINS OF ANGKOR</p>
<p>Sensei Napat lived atop the Mountains of Khmer centuries ago.   
He was a war mastermind, winning every battle he ever came across with the army of men that he raised up and commanded.
When away from battle, he was a Sensei to his village people and would often lecture to massive crowds of students that would come from afar.
"This is all about mental..." Shouted Sensei. </p>
